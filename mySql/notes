TCL
A transaction is a logical unit of work that contains one or more SQL statements. ... A transaction ends when it is committed or rolled back, 
either explicitly with a COMMIT or ROLLBACK statement or implicitly when a DDL statement is issued.

The transaction contains mainly four properties, which referred to as ACID property.
1. Atomicity
2. Consistency
3, Isolation
4. Durability

By default, MySQL automatically commits the changes permanently to the database. 
To force MySQL not to commit changes automatically, you use the following statement:
    SET autocommit = 0; 


Data Types
1. String
    CHAR(size) : it can have a maximum size of 255 characters.
    VARCHAR(size) : It can have a maximum size of 255 characters.
    TEXT(size) : Maximum size of 65,535 characters.
    MEDIUMTEXT(size) :  maximum size of 16,777,215 characters.
    LONGTEXT(size) :  4GB 

    BINARY(size) : 255 binary characters
    VARBINARY(size) : 255 binary characters

    ENUM : 1 or 2 bytes : each column may have one of the specified possible values. It uses numeric indexes (1, 2, 3…) to represent string values.

 2. Binary Large Object (BLOB)
    store binary data
    they can be used to store images or other multimedia files.
    
    TINYBLOB 	It can hold a maximum size of 255 bytes.
    BLOB(size) 	It can hold the maximum size of 65,535 bytes.
    MEDIUMBLOB 	It can hold the maximum size of 16,777,215 bytes.
    LONGBLOB 	It can hold the maximum size of 4gb or 4,294,967,295 bytes   

3. Date and Time 
    Date : Values range from '1000-01-01' to '9999-12-31'. : Displayed as 'yyyy-mm-dd'. It takes 3 bytes for storage. 
    Time : Values range from '-838:59:59' to '838:59:59'. : Displayed as 'HH:MM:SS'. It takes 3 bytes
    DateTime : Values range from '1000-01-01 00:00:00' to '9999-12-31 23:59:59'. : yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss 
    TimeStamp : Values range from '1970-01-01 00:00:01' UTC to '2038-01-19 03:14:07' :  Displayed as 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'. It takes 4 bytes 
    Year(2|4) : 0-99 or 1901-2155 

4. Numeric
    TINYINT : signed or unsigned, -128 to 127. If unsigned, the allowable range is from 0 to 255.
    SMALLINT : signed or unsigned, -32768 to 32767. If unsigned, the allowable range is from 0 to 65535. width of up to 5 digits
    MEDIUMINT : signed or unsigned,  9 digits. width of up to 9 digits
    INT : pecify a width of up to 11 digits. signed or unsigned, width of up to 11 digits
    BIGINT : can be signed or unsigned.  We can specify a width of up to 20 digits. It requires 8 bytes for storage.
    FLOAT(m,d) :  Decimal precision can go to 24 places for a float type. 
    DOUBLE(m,d) : Decimal precision can go to 53 places for a double. 
    DECIMAL(m,d) : display length (m) and the number of decimals (d) is required.  
    BIT :   It is used for storing bit values 
    BOOL :  It is used only for the true and false condition
    BOOLEAN : It is used only for the true and false condition, but stores TINYINT(1), stores 1 or 0.
