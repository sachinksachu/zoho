extends ('AbstractSet' which implements 'Set interface') and uses a hash table for storage.(Cloneable, Serializable )

1. stores the elements by using a mechanism called 'hashing'.
2. HashSet contains unique elements only, "no duplicates"
3. HashSet allows null value & non- sync.
4. doesn't maintain the insertion order
5. is the best approach for 'search' operations.


2. LinkedHashSet
    1. extends "HashSet" and implements "Set interface"
    2. Duplicate values are not allowed
    3. One NULL element is allowed 
    4. It is an ordered collection which is the order in which elements were inserted
    5. offers constant time performance for the basic operations(add, remove, contains and size).
    6. not sync
    7.

3. TreeSet
    1. extends 'AbstractSet' and implements 'NavigableSet interface'.
    2.  except it stores the element in sorted order.

    class TreeSet<E> extends AbstractSet<E> 
                implements NavigableSet<E>, Cloneable, Serializable 
        {
        //implementation
        }
    3. NULL is not allowed in TreeSet.
    4. ordered collection which store the elements in sorted order.
