 1.allows multiple inheritance
 2.All variables declared inside interface are implicitly public, static and final.
 3.Methods inside interface must not be static, final, 
 4.It is used to achieve full abstraction.All method in 'Interface' should be defined in sub class.
5.Cannot create instance of an Interface.
6.Interface can extend one or more other interface.But in this case, interface just inherit, does not provide implementation. 
Implementation can be provided by a class only.
An Interface can not contain a constructor methods.

7.It can have only abstract methods and static fields. 
 However, from Java 8, interface can have default and static methods and 
 from Java 9, it can have private methods as well.
