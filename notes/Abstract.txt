1. A class that is declared using “abstract” keyword is known as abstract class. 
2. It can have "abstract" methods(methods without body) as well as concrete methods (regular methods with body). 
3. An abstract class can not be instantiated, which means you are not allowed to create an object.
4. child classes will and should override the method in parent,
5. Abstract class cannot be instantiated which means you cannot create the object of it. 
    To use this class, you need to create another class that extends this this class and provides the implementation of abstract methods
