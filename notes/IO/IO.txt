streams are the sequence of data that are read from the source and written to the destination.

Types of Streams
1. Byte Stream [Byte stream is used to read and write a single byte (8 bits) of data.]
2. Character Stream [Character stream is used to read and write a single character of data.]

ByteStream
    1. All byte stream classes are derived from base abstract classes called 'InputStream' and 'OutputStream'.

Character Stream
    1. All the character stream classes are derived from base abstract classes 'Reader' and 'Writer'.

Combining Stream
    reading every byte one at a time from a file is slow. 
    It is faster to read a larger block of data from the disk and then iterate through that block byte for byte afterwards.
    To achieve buffering you can wrap your InputStream in an BufferedInputStream.

    example : InputStream input = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream("c:\\data\\input-file.txt"));
