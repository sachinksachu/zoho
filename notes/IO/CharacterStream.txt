The java.io package provides 'CharacterStream' classes to overcome the limitations of ByteStream classes, 
which can only handle the 8-bit bytes and is not compatible to work directly with the Unicode characters. 

CharacterStream classes are used to work with 16-bit Unicode characters. 
They can perform operations on characters, char arrays and Strings.

Divided into two
    1. Reader class
    2. Writer class

1. Reader

    BufferedReader
    InputStreamReader
    FileReader
    StringReader

    1.InputStreamReader
        i) is a bridge from byte streams to character streams:
        ii) It reads bytes and decodes them into "characters" using a specified charset. 
        iii) we can specify the type of character encoding (UTF8 or UTF16) in the file as well.

    2. FileReader
        i) used to read data (in characters) from files.
        ii) It extends the InputSreamReader class.
        
        to create file Reader
            1.FileReader input = new FileReader(String name);
            2.FileReader input = new FileReader(File fileObj);
        specify encoding
            FileReader input = new FileReader(String file, Charset cs);

    3. BufferedReader

        BufferReader readLine() returns String, terminate at "\n" or "\r".
        BufferReader read() returns single character.
        BufferReader read(CharBuffer target) , returns no. of characters read or -1 

2. Writer
    
    1.OutputStreamWriter

    write() - writes a single character to the writer
    write(char[] array) - writes the characters from the specified array to the writer
    write(String data) - writes the specified string to the writer

    2. FileWriter

    write() - writes a single character to the writer
    write(char[] array) - writes the characters from the specified array to the writer
    write(String data) - writes the specified string to the writer

"InputStreams" are used to read bytes from a stream. So they are useful for binary data such as images, video and serialized objects.

"Readers" on the other hand are character streams so they are best used to read character data.
