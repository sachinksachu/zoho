 1. to inherit property of another class.
 2. When a Class extends another class it inherits all " non-private " members including fields and methods.
 3. "extends" and "implements" keywords are used.
 
 4. It promotes the code reusabilty
 5. It promotes "polymorphism" by allowing "method overriding".

 6. We cannot extend the final class.

 Disadvantages 
    tightly coupled

7. constructor
      when sub class is instantiated, the constructor with no parameter in Parent class is called first then the Child constructor.
      if we want to call parameterized constructor of base class, then we can call it using super().
8. Why multiple inheritance is not supported in java?

   The C class inherits A and B classes. If A and B classes have the same method and you call it from child class object, 
   there will be ambiguity to call the method of A or B class. [compile time error]

9. Super keyword
